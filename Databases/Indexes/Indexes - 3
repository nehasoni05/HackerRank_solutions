MCQ-

Consider the following two designs to store the data using clustered indexes in MS SQL Server:
In the first design, the fill factor is 20% and the total number of free rows per page are A.

In the second design, the fill factor is 40% and the total number of free rows per page are B.

Which the followings describes the relation between A and B:
1) A = 1.33B
2) B = 1.33A
3) A = 0.67B
4) B = 0.67A

Correct Ans- A=1.33B

Explanation-
In case of A-
The space filled is 20% so remaining space is 80%.
In case of B-
The space filled is 40% so remaining space is 60.
Thus the relation between A and B is
A=1.33B (i.e 80%=1.33(60%))
